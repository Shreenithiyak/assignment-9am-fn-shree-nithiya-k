<!-- How would you handle an API call that takes time to respond? 
  if API call takes time becoz of internet and server delay 
    we can use async programming to handle such calls without blocking main thread

Why should long tasks not block the main thread?
 main thread = brain of browser(handles clicking,typing,scrolling,rendering UI)
 if it blocked mean page freezes,buttons doesn't work,it shows page not responding)
 
Which async method would you choose for a large application and why?
 for large application i would choose async/await because it makes code look synchronous 
  and easier to read and maintain

How do promises improve readability?
    promises allow chaining of then() methods 
    making it clear what happens after each async operation
    avoids callback hell and makes code more linear

How does async/await simplify debugging?
    async/await allows use of try/catch blocks for error handling
    making it easier to identify and handle errors in async code
